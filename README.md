# School_District_Analysis
Analyze school data using Pandas

##Summary statement

In this challenge, we were tasked with assisting Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, to prepare all standardized test data for analysis, reporting and presentation. We also needed to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. After aggregating the data, we were able to showcase trends in student math and reading performance. In addition, we made comparisons between budget allocations and student performance on standardized tests for charter schools and public schools. 

###Conclusions:

 - Even though, public schools receive slightly higher budget of 911195.5 when compared to charter schools, 872625.6, charter school student performance in math is on average 4-6 points higher than students in public schools respectively, for the exception of 12th grade. 
 - Montgomery HS has the highest student population of 2038 students, and Chang HS has the lowest, 171 students. It will be interesting to drill down into the student performance data to see if class sizes affect student performance levels when comparing high schools with high student population versus small student population.
